##  Immanuel Kimani â€“ Cybersecurity &  Developement

I'm a  developer and cybersecurity enthusiast focused on building tools that dig deep into how systems work â€” from disk-level scanners to real-time monitoring and red-team utilities.

I build stealthy, efficient, and insightful tools using low-level access and high-level abstraction.

### ðŸ”§ Key Projects

* **[Disk Scout](https://github.com/ManU4kym/disk_scout)** â€“
  Rust-based disk scanner for Windows. Recursively scans for hidden files and outputs a clean HTML report. Includes optional autorun persistence and uses low-level Windows APIs for file inspection.

* **Cloud Metrics Monitor (WIP)** â€“
  A Rust + Prometheus-based monitoring tool with real-time dashboards, webhook alerts, and multi-tenant support. Built for internal app observability with optional Grafana or custom chart UI.

* **[Mimi Nuxt Auth Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mimi-nuxt-auth-module)** â€“
  Lightweight, reusable Nuxt module for login/logout flow with a mock backend. Useful for scaffolding frontend apps quickly without backend dependency.
